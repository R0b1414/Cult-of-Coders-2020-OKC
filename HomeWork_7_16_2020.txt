You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

ROOT
    LEVEL1
            ðŸ—Žfile1.txt
            LEVEL2
                    ðŸ—Žfile2.txt

where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:
cd LEVEL1
rm file2.txt

What happens? Why?

This would not work for deleting file2.txt
instead it would return the error file2.txt does not exist


EXERCISE 4
You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

ROOT
    LEVEL1
            ðŸ—Žfile1.txt
            LEVEL2
                    ðŸ—Žfile2.txt

where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:
cd LEVEL1
rmdir LEVEL2
mkdir LEVEL3
cd LEVEL3
rm LEVEL3

command 1: current working directory is LEVEL1 
command 2: Would return an error because LEVEL2 does not exist in LEVEL1
command 3: This would Create a file called LEVEL3
command 4: This would change the working directory as LEVEL3
command 5: removing LEVEL3 is not possible because one it's the wronge command and two you cannot delete a file that you're in, instead it would return an error saying LEVEL3 does not exist...
